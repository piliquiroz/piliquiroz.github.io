For the first time ever I am directing play in Germany. I am doing this at the
Brechtbau Theatre a small theatre in TÃ¼bingen that supports amateur productions.
This place gives me the opportunity to learn how to create a play. I have chosen
a number of eager actors, now I have to put together this classic farce all by
my self, I am responsible for everything and that is very exiting and scary.I
love the idea of making this play, it is a farce full of silly jokes and
physical comedy.
