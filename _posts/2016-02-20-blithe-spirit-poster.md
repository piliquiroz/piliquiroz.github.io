For the first time ever I am directing a play in Germany. I am doing this at the
Brechtbau Theatre: a small theatre in TÃ¼bingen that supports amateur
productions. This place gives me the opportunity to learn how to create a play
from scratch. I have chosen a number of eager actors, now I have to put together
this classic farce all by my self, I am responsible for everything and that is
very exiting but also very scary.I love the idea of making this play, it is a
farce full of silly jokes and physical comedy.
