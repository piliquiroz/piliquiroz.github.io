Nehrener is a very small town close to TÃ¼bingen and I am here surrounded by very
German Germans. I feel fully integrated into German society now, I can hold a
conversation in German and I am starting to take part of this small events for
people who really live here. I used to spend most of my time with exchange
students, but little by little by studding the language and really through my
work I get to see more and more of this country.
