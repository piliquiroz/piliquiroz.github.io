It has been more than a year since I was on a stage. Moving to a new country has
proven to be very difficult and then when I was feeling like I was getting the
hang of things I had a stroke, that was last year. My body changed, particularly
my hands, and for a long time I was afraid of my body, and then I saw on Facebook
that this workshop was happening and on a whim I decided to go.

The workshop was called 'The Creating Body', by teachers Nicole
Kehrberger and Noam Meiri. I had heard many good things about Nicole during my
time at Ecole Philippe Gaulier so I just went. It was just a weekend but I was
pushed and it felt so good to be on my feet again. Since this was a workshop
about how to make your own show, I was forced to use my creativity. We also did
some acrobatics and that meant I had to get over my fear. I feel like I've
gotten my body back and I'm ready to perform again. I'm quitting my day job.
