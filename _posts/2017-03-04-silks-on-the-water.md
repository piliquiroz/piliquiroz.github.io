title: SchabenQuellen: Silks over water!
categories: silks performance
---

I am outside the building, climbing on top of a crystal dome to reach the
rigging point, it is cold and I am so very sick. I can see below me the pool and
people swimming, drinking and relaxing. I am in SchwabenQuellen a kind of spa
with saunas and pools and a gym. This performance is a funny one. I am to
perform three times to music I don't know, it is an improvisation, my friend
Carsten will play the sitar and I have to dance and we have to somehow feel each
other to know when the show is finish. I have to say I found the sitar a very
hard instrument to follow, but I do my thing I do bits of my routine and in the
end everyone looks please. I am so tired, I know I am not 100% and the changes
in temperature aren't helping but I get through it, thank you adrenaline it
carried me through and it all went well, tomorrow I will sleep all day.
