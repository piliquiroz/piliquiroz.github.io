title: Shooting with Hugo
categories: fun filming friends

I am in my wedding dress in the middle of a field shooting a movie with Hugo
Reis, of course I am. When Hugo asked me if I would want to be in his movie I
immediately said yes, he has the weirdest ideas and because of that it is always
fun to see the world through his eyes. We spent the first day walking around
TÃ¼bingen trying to find the perfect location. Initially, Hugo wanted me to be in
a field surrounded by sheep, but we weren't able to arrange that, instead we
ended up surrounded by wheat in the middle of a storm. I am never bored with
Hugo.
