title: First time directing after the stroke. What has changed?
categories: stroke directing

It happened on a Tuesday, I was naked in my bed, my body still tingling. My
husband was taking a shower and I reach for my phone I grabbed the phone and
tried to open the cover but I didn't manage, I couldn't do the movement. I tried
to stand up and my body fell down. Everything became like from another world. I
couldn't see normally, it was blurry like the world was in another place and I
was in bed naked and I didn't belong with the things that were around me.

My husband came into the room, he looked at me and said "you don't look good, what happened?"

I said - My hand doesn't work anymore, I can't open my phone
- What do you mean your hand doesn't work.
- It doesn't and look! I can't stand up...my head hurts.
- Could you count from 10 to 1 for me
- 10, 9, 8...8...10, 9, 8...I know is this, I know is in there somewhere
- Can you do it in Spanish
- No
- I think we have to go to the doctor.

I could speak like myself  but I couldn't think like myself and I couldn't move like myself.

The diagnosis was cerebral ischemia, I had had a stroke. I recovered relatively
quikly, when I was in the Hospital I almost felt normal but when I went back
into the world I noticed how many small things had changed. I found it difficult
to open bottles and work buttons and tie my shoes and most annoyingly I forget
things. I used to have very good memory, but now it is a bit fuzzy. About a week
after I came back from the hospital me and my husband wanted to watch a movie,
it was a Russian movie with subtitles, 10 minutes into the movie I realized that
I wasn't following the movie cause I couldn't remember what I read.

Six months later after the stroke I started working on my play. I felt almost
normal but my very good memory was gone, I used to memorize lines with no effort
and if I was working on a scene and someone, anyone forgot a line I would be
able to feed it to them, this time around I could not do that but I didn't know
it. I would still shout bits of text only this was normaly the wrong text and it
was imposible for me to look at the actors and follow the text. I needed to have
someone else look at the script so I could concentrate on the actors. It was an
interesting though painful process to relearn, to find a new way to do things,
it was difficult at times but I did it and next time it will be easier. Now that
is done I am happy I did it though in the middle of making the play I said many
times, never again.
