My friend Natalia invited me to come and teach a workshop for de theater group
Trastorno Obsesivo Teatral. They are a small independent cultural association
based in Bogot√° Colombia. This used to be my theater group many years ago when I
still lived in Colombia before I went to drama school. I accepted, this would be
the second time I taught this group, last year I received a similar invitation
and I had a great time, I was looking forward to build on the progress we had
made the year before. How ever things didn't go as planed.

When I arrived in Colombia my friend informed that they had lost the space they
had plan for the workshop. They had to hire a new space and pay for it and that
meant that we were no longer going to have this intimate experience that we had
plan where it was just me an a group of 7 people. They had to sell my workshop,
and they did but now instead on 7 people there were 14, and it was no longer one
group. I had to alter my plans completely. It was a learning experience for me
too.
