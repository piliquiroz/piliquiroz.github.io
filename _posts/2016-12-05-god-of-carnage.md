I saw a Colombian production of God of Carnage a long time ago and it must have
really made an impression because when I started to think which play I would
like to do next it was the first thing that came to mind. After making Blithe
Spirit it felt really good to direct something contemporary and it was a new
challenge for me to direct a play that is basically four people in a room
talking, but it isn't that at all, Yasmina Reza's text is beautiful and soon we
discovered that the play is not still *as in not moving? at all, it is full of
movement. I had amazing actors and the audience loved it.
