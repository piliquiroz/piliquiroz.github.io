title: Goodbye Europe, Hello Colombia!
categories: moving life colombia
---

The plan was to go to the Netherlands. My husband is Dutch and he was having
some health issues, we needed help and we wanted to be close to family, so how
did we end up in Colombia? We made the decision in an instant, something
happened and I suddenly thought, what about Colombia? I have family there and
our savings will go for longer in South America, the next day we bought tickets
and here we are, living in a little country house in the middle of rural
Colombia, with no plans. I had been living in Europe for seven years so coming
back won't be easy but we will see. I miss Tübingen sometimes, I met wonderful
people there, but Tübingen was also the place were my husband got incredibly
ill, so it is good to go and start a new chapter in our lives. We are well,
happy and resting.
