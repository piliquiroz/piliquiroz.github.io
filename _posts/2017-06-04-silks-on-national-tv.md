This has been with out a doubt the coolest job ever and I really wasn't
expecting it. When Himmelst√§nzerin Kompany asked me what I thought about being
part of an evangelical televised service I said "they would have to pay me a lot
of money" That was incredibly prejudice of me. I am not a Christian and I didn't
know if I was going to feel comfortable in that atmosphere, but in the end it
was not uncomfortable at all and very cool indeed. We arrived on Wednesday the
30th of May to rehearse. To hung the silks they had build a scaffold all to way
to the top. I went up and rigged the silks my self, it was a 12 meter hanging
point and a concrete floor so I had to make sure I felt safe, plus the hole
thing was going to be shown on live TV, it would't be good it I died in front of
all of those people. The security person had the same concern, he didn't know
what to do with himself, but I new I was safe, although it is true that you
never know.

It was very much like any other show, although it was not supposed to be a show
but a service, all the same there was a rehearsal, people carefully chose
costumes and practiced their lines and there was even a discussion about witch
praying position was better for television, but the reason I liked it so much
was the people, every one was incredibly kind and helpful from the director, to
the organizers to the priest. I am very happy I got to be part of this.
