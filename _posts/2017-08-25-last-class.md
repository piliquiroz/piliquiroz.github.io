And so my time with Himmelstänzerin ends. This was one of the funnest jobs I
have ever had. In the past year I got performe sixteen meters high up hanging
from a tree, in a church, at a German castel... I performed at weddings and
benefits and festivals and I taught many, many people children and adults. I
learn a lot, I think I am a better teacher now than when I started and I have
become a lot more confident as a performer. Thank you Eva.
