I am up in the air again. My teacher Eva was supposed to do this performance but
she hurt her shoulder so she gave it to me, and now here I am staring at a huge
tree. I had never performed so high up, 16 meters high to be exact, the rigging
was done by a tree surgeon and I performed a tango as part of the
literary-musical forest walk "KÃ¶nigin Charlotte und Bebenhausen". Today was
another first.
