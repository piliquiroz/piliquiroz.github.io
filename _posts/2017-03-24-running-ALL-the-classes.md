title: I take over all the Himmelst√§nzerin classes
categories: silks teaching
---

Last year in August my silks teacher injured her shoulder and asked me to star
teaching for her and to take over her performance work while she recovered,
since then we have been teaching together, but now she has to have a surgery and
so she has ask me to take over completely for all the regular lessons I will be
teaching three classes all on my own. This is an amazing opportunity, I am
already planing most of the lessons and I am really exited for this new
responsibility.
