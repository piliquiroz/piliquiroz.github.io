I am an actor, director, aerial performer and teacher. Originally from
Colombia, I moved to Paris to study theater. After training for one year at
École Jacques Lecoq I went on to study under Philippe Gaulier and graduated
from his two year theater program. Work and curiosity has led me to travel the
world; I have lived in many countries and worked in different productions in
Colombia, The Netherlands, England and Germany. After having spent three years
in Tübingen Germany I have come back to Colombia to get reacquainted with my
country and I am very happy to be here.
